\section{Introduction}

\reed{How do authors/affiiliations work for this?}
\langName is a DSL for implementing programs which manage resources, targeted at writing smart contracts.

\subsection{Contributions}

We make the following main contributions with \langName.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flow abstraction}: \langName uses a new abstraction called a \emph{flow} to encode semantic information about a program into the code.

    \item \textbf{Safety guarantees}: \langName ensures that resources are properly managed, eliminating double-spend and asset-loss bugs.

    \item \textbf{Conciseness}: \langName makes writing typical smart contract programs more concise by handling common patterns automatically.

    % \item \reed{Optimizations? Probably don't have time for this, unfortunately.}
    %     Some of the Solidity contracts are actually inefficient because:
    %     \begin{enumerate}
    %         \item They use lots of modifiers which repeat checks (see reference implementation of ERC-721).
    %         \item They tend to use arrays to represent sets.
    %             Maybe this is more efficient for very small sets, but checking containment is going to be much faster with a \lstinline{mapping (X => bool)} eventually.
    %     \end{enumerate}

    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item We can evaluate this by profiling or a simple opcode count (which is not only a proxy for performance, but also means that deploying the contract will be cheaper).
    %     \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

        handled by the language; these include handling overflow/underflow, checking of balances, short address attacks \reed{Do this}, string operations, etc.
        This conciseness is not only an improvement for a developers workflow, but also means that such issues are automatically handled, making it impossible for developers to forget them \reed{Wording}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We can evaluate these by comparing LOC, cyclomatic complexity, etc.
                Not sure what the right metric would be.
                \reed{Or how cyclomatic complexity would work exactly in this language.}

            \item We can also evaluate via a user study, but that will take a long(er) time.
        \end{itemize}

\section{Language Description}
The \langName language is built around the concept of a \emph{flow}, an atomic, state-changing operation describing the transfer of a resource.
Each flow has at least a \emph{source} and a \emph{destination}; they may optionally have a \emph{selector} or a transformer.
The source and destination are two storages which \emph{provide} and \emph{accept} resources, and the selector, if present, describes which part of the resource in the source should be transferred to the destination.
If not present, all resources will be transferred.

All flows fail if the selected resources are not present in the source, or if the selected resources cannot be added to the destination.
For example, a flow of fungible resources fails if there is not enough of the resource, and a flow of a nonfungible resource fails if the selected value doesn't exist in the source location.

\caption{Abstract syntax of the core calculus of \langName.}
\label{fig:lang-syntax}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:lang-syntax} shows a fragment of the syntax of the core calculus of \langName, which uses A-normal form \reed{cite} and makes several simplifications to the surface \langName language.
These simplifications can be performed automatically by the compiler.
\reed{TODO: The core calculus has been formalized (in K???).}

\section{Case Studies}
\subsection{ERC-20}
\reed{NOTE: I removed the MAX\_UINT thing that gives an unlimited approval from ERC20.sol, because that's not part of the standard and not particularly interesting.}
\reed{Cite properly Solidity code properly}
\reed{Currently omitting events entirely because we handle them exactly like Solidity does.}

Figure~\ref{fig:erc20-impl} shows implementations of the ERC-20 \reed{cite} standard in both Solidity and \langName, one of the most commonly implemented standards on the Ethereum blockchain \reed{cite}.

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{A Solidity and a \langName implementation of the core functions of the ERC-20 standard.}
    \label{fig:erc20-impl}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{The DAO attack}
\reed{Describe attack}
We can prevent the DAO attack (the below is from \url{https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/}):
\begin{lstlisting}
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    // At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again
    require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""));
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In \langName, we would write this as:

\begin{lstlisting}
transaction withdrawBalance():
    userBalances[msg.sender] --> msg.sender.balance
\end{lstlisting}

Because of the additional information encoded in the flow construct, the compiler can output the safe version of the above code---reducing the balance before peforming the call---without any user intervention.
