\section{Introduction}
Blockchains are increasingly used as platforms for applications called \emph{smart contracts}~\cite{Szabo97:Formalizing}, which automatically manage transactions in an unbiased, mutually agreed-upon way.
Commonly proposed and implemented smart contracts include supply chain management~\cite{SupplyChainUse}, healthcare~\cite{HealthcareUse}, \emph{token contracts}, voting, crowdfunding, auctions, and more~\cite{Elsden18:Making}.
A \emph{token contract} is a contract implementing a \emph{token standard}, such as ERC-20~\cite{erc20}.
Smart contracts often manage \emph{digital assets}, such as cryptocurrencies, or, depending on the application, bids in an auction, votes in an election, and so on.
Token contracts are common on the Ethereum blockchain~\cite{wood2014ethereum}---about 73\% of high-activity contracts are token contracts~\cite{OlivaEtAl2019}.
Smart contracts cannot be patched after being deployed, even if a security vulnerability is discovered.
% Developers must carefully review contracts, and some use an independent auditing service to help with this process.
% Despite this extra care, discoveries of vulnerabilities still occur regularly, often costing large amounts of money.
% Vulnerabilities still occur regularly, often costing large amounts of money.
% The well-known DAO attack~\cite{DAO} caused the loss of over 40 million dollars.
Some estimates suggest that as many as 46\% of smart contracts may have some vulnerability~\cite{luuOyente}.

    \label{fig:erc20-transfer-sol}
\end{figure}

\langName (\langNamePronounce) is a new programming language we are designing around a new abstraction, a \emph{flow}, representing an atomic transfer operation.
% which is useful in smart contracts managing digital \assetTxt{}s.
Flows allow encoding semantic information about the flow of \assetTxt{}s into the code.
The \langName language will also provide features to mark types with \emph{modifiers}, such as \flowinline{asset}, which combine with flows to make some classes of bugs impossible.

Solidity is the most commonly-used smart contract language on the Ethereum blockchain~\cite{EthereumForDevs}, and does not provide analogous support for managing \assetTxt{}s.
Additionally, typical smart contracts are more \textbf{concise} in \langName than in Solidity, because \langName handles common patterns and pitfalls automatically.

Other newly-proposed blockchain languages include Flint, Move, Nomos, Obsidian, and Scilla~\cite{schrans2018flint, blackshear2019move, das2019nomos, coblenz2019obsidian, sergey2019scilla}.
Scilla and Move are intermediate-level languages, whereas \langName is a high-level language.
Obsidian, Move, Nomos, and Flint use linear or affine types to manage \assetTxt{}s; \langName uses \emph{type quantities}, which provide the benefits of \emph{linear types}, but give a more precise analysis of the flow of values in a program.
None of the these languages have flows or provide support for all the modifiers that \langName does.

\section{Language}\label{sec:lang}
A \langName program is made of \emph{contracts}, each containing \emph{fields}, \emph{types}, and \emph{functions}.
Each contract instance in \langName represents a contract on the blockchain, and the fields provide persistent storage.
% Type declarations allow annotating values with modifiers, such as $\asset$.
% We distinguish between three types of function: \emph{transactions}, \emph{views}, and \emph{transformers}.
% Transactions and views are both \emph{methods}, which may access the fields of a contract; a transaction can read \textbf{and} write fields, whereas a view may only read fields.
% A transformer is a \textbf{pure} function, which is not part of any contract: it may contain flows and other statements, and it may mutate \textbf{local} state, but it cannot mutate the state of any contract.
Figure~\ref{fig:erc20-transfer-flow} shows a simple contract declaring a type, a field, and a transaction, which implements the core of ERC-20's \lstinline{transfer} function.
ERC-20 is a standard for token contracts managing \textbf{fungible} tokens, and provides a bare-bones interface for this purpose.
\begin{figure}[!b]
    \centering
    \lstinputlisting[language=flow, xrightmargin=-1.0em]{splash20-examples/erc20-transfer.flow}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \caption{A \langName contract with a simple \lstinline{transfer} function, which transfers \lstinline{amount} tokens from the sender's account to the destination account.
It is implemented with a single flow, which automatically checks all the preconditions to ensure the transfer is valid.}
    \label{fig:erc20-transfer-flow}
\end{figure}

\langName is built around the concept of a \emph{flow}. %, an atomic, state-changing operation describing the transfer of values.
Using the more declarative, \emph{flow-based} approach provides the following advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precondition checking}: \langName automatically inserts dynamic checks of a flow's validity; e.g., a flow of money would fail if there is not enough in the source, or if there is too much in the destination (e.g., due to overflow).
        % Flows can also fail for other reasons: a developer may specify that a certain flow must send all \assetTxt{}s matching a predicate, but in addition specify an expected \emph{quantity} that must be selected: any number, exactly one, or at least one.
    \item \textbf{Data-flow tracking}: We hypothesize that flows provide a clearer way of specifying how resources flow in the code itself, which may be less apparent using other approaches, especially in complicated contracts. %such as those involving transfer fees.
        Additionally, developers must explicitly mark when \assetTxt{}s are \emph{consumed}, and only assets marked as \flowinline{consumable} may be consumed. % , which we hypothesize leads to fewer accidental asset loss bugs.
    \item \textbf{Error messages}: When a flow fails, \langName provides automatic, descriptive error messages, such as
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, basicstyle=\small\ttfamily, xleftmargin=-5.0ex]
Cannot flow <amount> Token from account[<src>] to account[<dst>]:
    source only has <balance> Token.
\end{lstlisting}
        Flows enable such messages by encoding all the necessary information into the program.%, instead of using low-level operations like increment and decrement.
\end{itemize}

Each variable, field, and function parameter has a \emph{type quantity}, approximating the number of values in the variable, which is one of: $\emptyq$, $\any$, $\exactlyone$, $\nonempty$, $\every$ (``$\exactlyone$'' means ``exactly one'').
Type quantities are inferred if omitted.
Only $\emptyq$ \assetTxt variables may be dropped.

\emph{Modifiers} can be used to place constraints on how values are managed: \flowinline{asset}, \flowinline{fungible}, \flowinline{unique}, \flowinline{immutable}, and \flowinline{consumable}.
An \flowinline{asset} is a value that must not be reused or accidentally lost.
A \flowinline{fungible} value represents a quantity that can be \textbf{merged}, and it is \textbf{not} \flowinline{unique}.
For example, ERC-20 tokens are \flowinline{fungible}.
A \flowinline{immutable} value cannot be changed; in particular, it cannot be the source or destination of a flow.
A \flowinline{unique} value only exists in at most one variable; it must be \flowinline{immutable} and an \flowinline{asset} to ensure it is not duplicated.
ERC-721 tokens are \flowinline{unique} and \flowinline{immutable}.
A \flowinline{consumable} value is an \flowinline{asset} that it may be appropriate to dispose of, done via the \flowinline{consume} construct, documenting that the disposal is intentional.

\langName has transactional semantics: a sequence of flows will either all succeed, or, if a single flow fails, the rest will fail as well.
If a sequence of flows fails, the error propagates, like an exception, until it either: a) reaches the top level, and the entire transaction fails; or b) reaches a \flowinline{catch}, and then only the changes made in the corresponding \flowinline{try} block will be reverted, and the code in the \flowinline{catch} block will be executed.

\subsection{ERC-20}\label{sec:erc20-impl}
Figure~\ref{fig:erc20-transfer-sol} shows a Solidity implementation of the ERC-20 function \lstinline{transfer} (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:erc20-transfer-flow}).
Each ERC-20 contract manages the ``bank accounts'' for its own tokens, keeping track of how many tokens each user has; users are represented by addresses.
This example shows the advantages of flows in precondition checking, data-flow tracking, and error messages.
In this case, the sender's balance must be at least as large as \flowinline{amount}, and the destination's balance must not overflow when it receives the tokens.
Psamathe automatically inserts code checking these two conditions, ensuring that the checks are not forgotten.

\subsection{Voting}\label{sec:voting-impl}
\begin{figure}[!b]
    \centering
    \lstinputlisting[language=flow]{splash20-examples/voting.flow}
    \vspace{-1em}
    \caption{A simple voting contract in \langName.}
    \label{fig:voting-impl-flow}
\end{figure}
One proposed use for blockchains is for voting~\cite{Elsden18:Making}.
Figures~\ref{fig:voting-impl-sol} and~\ref{fig:voting-impl-flow} show the core of an implementation of a voting contract in Solidity and \langName, respectively, based on the Solidity by Example tutorial~\cite{solidityByExample}.
Each contract instance has several proposals, and users must be given permission to vote by the chairperson, assigned in the constructor of the contract (not shown).
Each user can vote exactly once for exactly one proposal, and the proposal with the most votes wins.

This example shows \langName is suited for a range of applications.
It also shows some uses of the $\unique$ modifier; in this contract, $\unique$ ensures that each user, represented by an \lstinline{address}, can be given permission to vote at most once, while the use of $\asset$ ensures that votes are not lost or double-counted.
% The Solidity implementation is also more verbose than the \langName implementation because it must work around the limitations of the mapping structure.
% In this example, the \lstinline{weight} and \lstinline{voted} members of the \lstinline{Voter} struct exist so that the contract can tell whether a voter has the default values, was authorized to vote, or has already voted.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have presented the \langName language for writing safer smart contracts.
\langName uses the new flow abstraction, \assetTxt{}s, and modifiers to provide safety guarantees for smart contracts.
We showed two examples of smart contracts in both Solidity and \langName, showing that \langName is capable of expressing common smart contract functionality in a concise manner, while retaining key safety properties.

In the future, we plan to implement the \langName language, and prove its safety properties.
We also hope to study the benefits of the language via case studies, performance evaluation, and the application of flows to other domains.
Finally, we would also like to conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of the flow abstraction and the design of the language, and to compare it to Solidity, which we hypothesize will show that developers write contracts with fewer asset management errors in \langName than in Solidity.
