// Want to be able to lookup Items by id OR by the name of the user who owns them

// Standard Solidity:
struct Item {
    uint256 id;
    uint256 price;
}

struct User {
    string name;
    Item[] items:
}

mapping (nat => Item) items;
mapping (string => User) users;
// Might even have more fields here, to allow for iteration over users/items

// Flow language version:
type Item is asset {
    id : nat,
    price : nat
}

type User is asset {
    name : string
}

items : linking User <=> set Item

// Alternate proposal
type Item is asset {
    id : nat,
    price : nat
}

type User is asset {
    name : string,
    items : set Item
}

items : collection Item identified by User or id
