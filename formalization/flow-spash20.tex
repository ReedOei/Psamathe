\section{Introduction}

\langName is a DSL for implementing programs which manage resources, targeted at writing smart contracts.

\subsection{Contributions}

We make the following main contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Safety guarantees}: similar to \reed{or maybe just exactly} linear types\reed{or maybe uniqueness types? need to read more about this}, preventing accidental resource loss or duplication.
        Additionally, provides some amount of reentrancy safety.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item We can evaluate these by formalizing the language and proving them; the formalization is something that would be nice to do anyway.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Conciseness}: \langName is simple---it makes writing typical smart contract programs more concise, because many common patterns are automatically handled by the language; these include handling overflow/underflow, checking of balances, short address attacks \reed{Do this}, string operations, etc.
        This conciseness is not only an improvement for a developers workflow, but also means that such issues are automatically handled, making it impossible for developers to forget them \reed{Wording}.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item We can evaluate these by comparing LOC, cyclomatic complexity, etc.
                Not sure what the right metric would be.
                \reed{Or how cyclomatic complexity would work exactly in this language.}

            \item We can also evaluate via a user study, but that will take a long(er) time.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \reed{Optimizations? Probably don't have time for this, unfortunately.}
        Some of the Solidity contracts are actually inefficient because:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item They use lots of modifiers which repeat checks (see reference implementation of ERC-721).
            \item They tend to use arrays to represent sets.
                Maybe this is more efficient for very small sets, but checking containment is going to be much faster with a \lstinline{mapping (X => bool)} eventually.
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item We can evaluate this by profiling or a simple opcode count (which is not only a proxy for performance, but also means that deploying the contract will be cheaper).
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Language Intro}

The basic state-changing construct in the language is a \emph{flow}.
A flow describes a transfer of a \emph{resource} from one \emph{storage} to another.
A \emph{transaction} is a sequence of statements.

Each flow has a \emph{source}, a \emph{destination}, and a \emph{selector}.
The source and destination are two storages which hold a resource, and the selector describes which part of the resource in the source should be transferred to the destination.
A flow may optionally have a \emph{name}.

Note that all flows fail if they can't be performed.
For example, a flow of fungible resources fails if there is enough of the resource, and a flow of a nonfungible resource fails if the selected value doesn't exist in the source location.

\paragraph{The DAO attack}
We can prevent the DAO attack (the below is from \url{https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/}):
\begin{lstlisting}
function withdrawBalance() public {
    uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
    // At this point, the caller's code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again
    require(msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""));
    userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In \langName, we would write this as:

\begin{lstlisting}
transaction withdrawBalance():
    userBalances[msg.sender] --> msg.sender.balance
\end{lstlisting}

Not only is this simpler, but the compiler can automatically place the actual call that does the transfer last, meaning that the mistake could simply never be made.

\section{Code Examples}

\reed{NOTE: I removed the MAX\_UINT thing that gives an unlimited approval from ERC20.sol, because that's not part of the standard and not particularly interesting.}
