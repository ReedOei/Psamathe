- It would be cool to have dataflow-like programming available, so I could say:
    - dataflow X := f()
    - So that whenever one of the dependencies of X is updated, teh value of X is also updated.

- How to figure out where to put stuff (e.g., memory, calldata, storage, etc.)?
    - Can we do this automatically and easily?

- Automatic optimizations:
    - We will typically track "total" for an asset automatically (i.e., the amount in circulation + the amount in any given storage)
        - However, if never used, then we can omit it.
    - In a `flow one x such that P from A to B`, we can detect when the condition P will always designate at most one object and then do an early exit when we're doing the search.
    - This is somewhat starting to enter query-optimizer-land, so probably out of scope.

    - If we use checking to see if a key is in a mapping, then we create a separate mapping (X => bool) to store this info, otherwise we don't.
        - Of course, depends exactly how we compile, if we ever get around to actually implementing the langauge.

- We should allow string equality tests, and just do the keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(b)) thing under the hood.

- How to handle inheritance and interfaces, if at all?
    - Related: how to interface with Solidity or Obsidian code, if needed?

- Token is kind of like an existential type, sealed inside ERC-20 bank
    - I was really thinking of it more like a path-dependent type.
    - Not sure what the "right" way is.

- What should be part of the static contract construct and what should be an instance?
    - e.g., should resources, sinks be static or dynamically created.
    - Not being able to this makes it kind of awkward to make a token exchange, for example.

- Look at other applications that are not ERC-20 and try to write them.
    - Try other research projects examples?
        - https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.5555/3355356
    - Implement other proofs of concept
    - Maybe look at the testnet too (is there a corpus available here?)
    - That one voting application I found is somewhat interesting.
